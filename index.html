                    The phrase "He's in your walls" was popularized by an Indian folktale that details the kidnappings of children from their homes by Reese.

                    When Reese was a child, he liked to kill little animals. He would go outside and say, "Birds, Turtles, and Squirrels. 
                    I can't wait to kill them all in a swirl!" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has now grown to be 22. He has killed many little critters and has officially moved on to... bigger prey. He hunts in the streets
                    of Auburn, Alabama. When the clock strikes 10 at night, he comes out to give people a fright. While his current kill count is unknown,
                    authorities estimate he has killed 200 children, 400 women and 1 man.
